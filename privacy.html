  <h1>Privacy Policy – Astra</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 7, 2025</p>
  <hr>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Astra respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your data while operating within Discord servers.
    This policy explains what information is accessed, how it’s used, and how it’s safeguarded.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data Collected</h2>
  <p>
    Astra may temporarily access limited data required to perform its functions, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Messages sent to the bot (for command processing and responses)</li>
    <li>User ID and username (for identifying user interactions)</li>
    <li>Server ID (for saving configurations and server-specific settings)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Astra does <strong>not</strong> store or collect sensitive personal information such as passwords, payment details,
    or private messages outside of bot-related interactions.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Usage</h2>
  <p>
    Collected data is used solely for bot functionality, including moderation, automation, and command processing.
    Temporary logs may be kept for debugging, error resolution, or backup purposes.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    Astra does not share, sell, or distribute data to third parties.
    Data may be visible only to authorized Discord server administrators for management purposes.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    User data and logs are retained only as long as necessary for Astra’s operation or as required for debugging and stability.
    Periodic data cleanups are performed to minimize stored information.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Security</h2>
  <p>
    Astra uses best-effort security measures to protect user data.
    However, no system can be guaranteed completely secure. Use Astra at your own discretion.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Updates</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically to reflect improvements or compliance updates.
    Continued use of Astra after changes indicates your acceptance of the updated policy.
  </p>
